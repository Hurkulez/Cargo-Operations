HOW TO USE:

1. Follow instructions in install.txt

2. Go to your Admin Center -> Addons -> CargoOps

3. First you need to setup your CargoOps Center (Go to CargoOps Settings)

4. Go to "Add Cargo Types" and add several different types of Cargo for the system to use.

5. Go to "Add Cargo Aircraft" and add all your cargo aircraft to the system.

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST FILL OUT ALL OF THE FIELDS IN THE CARGOTYPE AND AIRCRAFT FORMS!

6. AFTER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS COMPLETED click "Reset Contracts Now"! This will create your first contracts and you are ready to go flying!

OPTIONAL:
You may set up a cron job to create new contracts once a day or so. If you do please select Cron Job Active "YES" on the CargoOps Settings page.
Else new contracts are created whenever a pilot visits the CargoOps page and the Contract Pool isnt filled.

URL for the cron job would be:
